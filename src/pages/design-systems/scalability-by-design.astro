A design system that cannot scale is a short-lived asset.

Scalability by design means building the system with the assumption
that products, teams, and use cases **will grow and change**.

Scalability is not achieved by adding more components,
but by defining foundations that remain stable as complexity increases.

## Approach

#### Design foundations to outlive features

Foundations should change slower than the products built on top of them.

    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Invest early in tokens, spacing, typography, and motion rules.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Tie foundations to a single product or feature.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Use semantic tokens instead of hardcoded values.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Encode brand or layout decisions directly in components.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Anticipate variation, not specific solutions

Scalable systems support change without knowing its exact form.
    `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Design extension points and safe defaults.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Optimize components for only current requirements.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Allow controlled variation through tokens and composition.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Fork components to handle edge cases.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Separate global decisions from local ones

Not every decision should scale at the same level.
    `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Centralize rules that must remain consistent across products.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Force global decisions into local contexts.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Allow teams to adapt patterns within defined constraints.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Lock every design choice at the system level.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Design for multiple teams and workflows

A scalable design system supports parallel work without collisions.
    `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Provide clear contribution and extension guidelines.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Rely on tribal knowledge to evolve the system.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Use versioning and deprecation strategies.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Introduce breaking changes without migration paths.</UsageItem>

#### Why this principle matters

Scalability ensures the design system remains an enabler rather than a bottleneck.

When growth is expected and designed for,
the system can evolve without constant rewrites or fragmentation.
