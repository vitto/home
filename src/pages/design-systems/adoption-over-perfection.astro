When I design and evolve a design system, I prioritize **adoption over theoretical perfection**.

A system that is partially imperfect but widely used creates more value than a refined system that teams avoid or bypass.

In real production environments, design systems compete with:

- delivery pressure,
- legacy constraints,
- and existing team habits.

Optimizing exclusively for conceptual purity often leads to:

- over-engineered abstractions,
- slow onboarding,
- and parallel solutions emerging outside the system.

Instead, I treat adoption as a primary success metric.

The system must be usable, approachable, and immediately helpful—even if that means accepting known limitations and planning to evolve them later.

## Approach

---

#### Shipping usable components before ideal abstractions

Early system components are designed to solve concrete, recurring problems rather than to establish a perfectly generalized model.

    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Start from real use cases already present in the product.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Delay release waiting for a complete abstraction.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Ship components that reduce immediate friction for teams.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Design components in isolation from real product needs.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Progressive refinement instead of upfront completeness

The system is allowed to grow iteratively as new needs emerged.
`}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Release a minimal, stable API and evolve it based on usage.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Attempt to predict every single future requirement.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Treat missing features as opportunities for informed iteration.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Block adoption due to incomplete coverage.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
  #### Accepting inconsistencies to enable onboarding

  Some inconsistencies are tolerated temporarily to avoid breaking existing products or workflows.
  `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Allow transitional states when migrating to the system.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">
        Enforce strict compliance that blocks teams from adopting the system.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Document known limitations and planned improvements.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Introduce breaking changes prematurely.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
  #### Documentation optimized for first use, not completeness

  Documentation is written to help teams succeed quickly rather than to describe the entire system exhaustively.
  `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Focus on common scenarios and recommended paths.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">
        Prioritize exhaustive reference documentation over practical guidance.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Provide examples that teams can apply immediately.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Assume deep system knowledge from new adopters.</UsageItem>

  #### Reducing contribution friction

  Contribution processes were designed to encourage participation rather than enforce gatekeeping.

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Lower the barrier to proposing changes or improvements.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Require excessive upfront justification.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Make contribution paths visible and understandable.</UsageItem>

  #### Measuring success through usage, not elegance

  System success was evaluated based on real adoption and impact.

#### Why this principle matters

A design system does not fail because it is imperfect.

It fails when teams stop trusting it as a practical tool.

By prioritizing adoption over perfection:

- the system remains connected to real product work,
- teams feel supported rather than constrained,
- and improvement becomes continuous instead of theoretical.

Perfection is static.

Adoption creates momentum.
