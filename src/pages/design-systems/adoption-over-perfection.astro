When I design and evolve a design system, I prioritize **adoption over theoretical perfection**.

A system that is partially imperfect but widely used creates more value than a refined system that teams avoid or bypass.

In real production environments, design systems compete with:

- delivery pressure,
- legacy constraints,
- and existing team habits.

Optimizing exclusively for conceptual purity often leads to:

- over-engineered abstractions,
- slow onboarding,
- and parallel solutions emerging outside the system.

Instead, I treat adoption as a primary success metric.

The system must be usable, approachable, and immediately helpful—even if that means accepting known limitations and planning to evolve them later.

#### Why this principle matters

A design system does not fail because it is imperfect.

It fails when teams stop trusting it as a practical tool.

By prioritizing adoption over perfection:

- the system remains connected to real product work,
- teams feel supported rather than constrained,
- and improvement becomes continuous instead of theoretical.

Perfection is static.

Adoption creates momentum.
