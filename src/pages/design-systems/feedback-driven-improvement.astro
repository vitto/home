A design system that doesn't respond to feedback becomes disconnected from reality.

Feedback-driven improvement means the system evolves based on:

- how teams actually use it,
- what problems they encounter,
- and what they need to build better products.

Without feedback loops, the system team operates in isolation,
making assumptions that may not match real-world needs.

#### Why this principle matters

Feedback-driven improvement keeps the design system relevant and useful.

When teams see their input leads to real changes,
they become more invested in the system and more likely to contribute.

Systems that ignore feedback become disconnected from user needs
and eventually lose adoption and trust.
