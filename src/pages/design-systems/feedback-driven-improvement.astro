A design system that doesn't respond to feedback becomes disconnected from reality.

Feedback-driven improvement means the system evolves based on:

- how teams actually use it,
- what problems they encounter,
- and what they need to build better products.

Without feedback loops, the system team operates in isolation,
making assumptions that may not match real-world needs.

## Approach

---

#### Collect feedback systematically

Feedback should be easy to give and easy to process.
      `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Provide clear channels for feedback (forms, issues, surveys).
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Rely solely on informal conversations or hallway chats.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Make feedback collection part of regular workflows.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Wait for feedback to come to you.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

      content={`
#### Measure actual usage

Data reveals what teams really need, not just what they say they need.
      `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Track component usage and adoption patterns.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Assume all components are equally valuable.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Identify unused or underused components.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Ignore metrics that suggest components aren't working.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Act on feedback visibly

Teams need to see that their input leads to change.
      `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Acknowledge feedback promptly and transparently.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Collect feedback without responding or acting on it.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Communicate when and how feedback influenced decisions.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">
        Make changes without explaining the connection to feedback.
      </UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Prioritize based on impact

Not all feedback is equally important.
      `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Prioritize changes that affect many teams or critical workflows.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Treat all feedback requests with equal urgency.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Balance quick wins with strategic improvements.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Only pursue large, complex changes.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Close the feedback loop

Feedback should inform decisions, not just sit in a backlog.
      `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Regularly review feedback and usage data to inform roadmap.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Collect feedback without integrating it into planning.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Share how feedback shaped system improvements.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Make decisions in isolation from user needs.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Why this principle matters

Feedback-driven improvement keeps the design system relevant and useful.

When teams see their input leads to real changes,
they become more invested in the system and more likely to contribute.

Systems that ignore feedback become disconnected from user needs
and eventually lose adoption and trust.
