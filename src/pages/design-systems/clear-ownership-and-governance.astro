A design system without ownership is a temporary collection of assets.

Clear ownership and governance define **who decides**, **how decisions are made**,
and **how the system evolves** over time.

Without governance, consistency erodes, contributions slow down,
and the system becomes a source of friction instead of alignment.

#### Why this principle matters

Clear ownership and governance prevent entropy.

They enable the system to evolve deliberately,
support multiple teams, and remain trusted over time.
