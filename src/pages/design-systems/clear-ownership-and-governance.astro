A design system without ownership is a temporary collection of assets.

Clear ownership and governance define **who decides**, **how decisions are made**,
and **how the system evolves** over time.

Without governance, consistency erodes, contributions slow down,
and the system becomes a source of friction instead of alignment.

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Assign clear owners for foundations, components, and documentation.

      <UsageItem variant="dont">Assume collective ownership without accountability.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Make ownership discoverable in documentation.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Rely on informal or implicit responsibility.</UsageItem>

#### Establish decision-making processes

Governance is about enabling decisions, not blocking them.

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Define how changes are proposed, reviewed, and approved.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Handle decisions ad hoc or in private channels.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Document acceptance criteria and design principles.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Approve changes without shared evaluation standards.</UsageItem>

#### Balance control and autonomy

Strong governance creates alignment without centralizing every decision.

      <UsageItem variant="dont">Micro-manage local or contextual adaptations.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Allow teams to extend the system within defined boundaries.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Force one-size-fits-all solutions.</UsageItem>

#### Make contribution paths explicit

A system that cannot be extended will eventually be bypassed.

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Provide clear contribution guidelines and templates.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Require insider knowledge to contribute.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Review contributions with cross-disciplinary input.</UsageItem>

#### Why this principle matters

Clear ownership and governance prevent entropy.

They enable the system to evolve deliberately,
support multiple teams, and remain trusted over time.
