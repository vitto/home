When I work on design systems, I prioritize **consistency of behavior, meaning, and interaction** over rigid visual or structural uniformity.

Uniformity optimizes for sameness; consistency optimizes for understanding.

In complex products and multi-team environments, enforcing strict uniformity often leads to:

- fragile abstractions,
- forced components,
- and local workarounds that quietly undermine the system.

A consistent system, instead, allows contextual variation while preserving:

- predictable behaviors,
- shared mental models,
- and recognizable interaction patterns.

The system defines **what must remain consistent** and **where variation is allowed**, making adaptability an explicit design decision rather than an accidental one.

  #### Shared behavior, contextual presentation

  Components addressing similar needs were designed to behave consistently, even when their visual presentation differed based on context.

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Keep interaction patterns (focus, keyboard navigation, error handling) consistent.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">
        Force identical layouts when context changes user intent.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Allow visual adaptations when context requires different emphasis or density.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Redesign interaction logic for each visual variant.</UsageItem>

  #### Semantic consistency over visual sameness

  Similar UI elements were aligned semantically rather than visually.
    `}

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Use the same component or pattern when the meaning and intent are the same.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">
        Create visually identical components with different meanings.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Let spacing, size, or hierarchy adapt to the surrounding layout.

  #### Variant systems with clear intent

  Similar UI elements were aligned semantically rather than visually.

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Define variants around intent (e.g. emphasis, hierarchy, feedback).
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Introduce variants to satisfy isolated design needs.</UsageItem>

  #### Consistent constraints across flexible compositions

  Composable components were allowed to combine freely, but within shared constraints.

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Enforce consistent spacing, alignment rules, and accessibility constraints.
