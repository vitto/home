Accessibility is not an enhancement.
It is the **baseline quality bar** of a design system.

When accessibility is treated as optional, it is postponed, fragmented,
or removed under pressure.
When treated as a baseline, it becomes invisible, reliable, and scalable.

## Approach

#### Design accessible by default

Accessibility should be built into foundations and components from the start.
    `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">
        Use accessible color contrast as a non-negotiable constraint.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Rely on manual fixes after components are shipped.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Define focus, hover, and active states consistently.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Leave interactive states undefined.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Encode accessibility into components

Accessibility should be expressed through behavior, not documentation alone.
    `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Bake ARIA roles and keyboard support into components.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Expect consumers to add accessibility features manually.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Provide accessible defaults that work out of the box.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">
        Ship components that require extra effort to be accessible.
      </UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Treat accessibility as a system concern

Accessibility issues multiply when handled at the product level.
    `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Centralize accessibility patterns and decisions.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">
        Solve the same accessibility problem in multiple products.
      </UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Document accessibility guarantees per component.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Leave accessibility expectations implicit.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

    <Markdown
      content={`
#### Test and validate continuously

Accessibility is not static and must be maintained over time.
    `}
    />

    <Usage>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Include keyboard and screen reader testing in reviews.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Assume accessibility remains intact by default.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="do">Use automated checks to catch regressions.</UsageItem>
      <UsageItem variant="dont">Rely solely on manual audits.</UsageItem>
    </Usage>

#### Why this principle matters

Accessibility as a baseline ensures inclusivity, legal compliance,
and long-term system resilience.

When accessibility is built into the system,
teams move faster because they don’t have to re-solve the same problems.
