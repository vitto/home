When I design a design system, I treat it as the **single authoritative source** for components, patterns, accessibility rules, and behavioral decisions.

This approach reduces ambiguity, subjective interpretation, and divergence between design and development.

In practice, I have consistently observed that when multiple "sources of truth" coexist—design files, local implementations, undocumented patterns—teams start to:

- duplicate solutions,
- rebuild components locally,
- and make visual or technical decisions outside the system.

For this reason, anything that is not expressed within the design system should not be considered official.
Every extension or change must pass through the system itself, in an explicit, documented, and versioned way.

The goal is not control, but **clarity**: enabling teams to trust the system and focus on product work rather than interpretation and reconciliation.

#### Storybook as the primary reference

In a production design system I worked on, Storybook was intentionally positioned as the **operational source of truth**, not as a secondary showcase.
