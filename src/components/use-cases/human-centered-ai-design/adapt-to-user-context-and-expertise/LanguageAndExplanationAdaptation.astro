            What seed mixes are best for attracting finches and tits in winter, considering the

For finches and tits in winter, where cats are present, I recommend:

1. **Leftover mix:** Black sunflower seeds (rich in oil), niger (for finches), and unsalted peanuts (for tits).
2. **Strategic placement:** Use a tube feeder with small holes (for finches) or a cage-style feeder (for tits), hung at least 1.8 meters high and away from branches where cats can climb.
3. **Additional protection:** Add a baffle (plastic disc) over the feeder to deter cats.
