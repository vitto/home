  <Usage>
    <UsageItem variant="do">
      State that the AI suggests or drafts and that the user decides, approves, or is responsible
      for the final outcome.
    </UsageItem>
    <UsageItem variant="dont">
      Let the AI take actions (e.g. send, publish) without making the user's approval and
      responsibility clear.
    </UsageItem>
    <UsageItem variant="do">
      Use consistent language (e.g. "suggestion", "draft") so the division of roles is obvious.
    </UsageItem>
    <UsageItem variant="dont">
      Use wording that implies the AI has made the decision or that the user is not accountable.
