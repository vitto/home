      Use language like "precise", "accurate", or "trust our AI" without guidance on when to verify.

    <UsageItem variant="do">
      When the system is uncertain or conditions are edge-case, say so and suggest human
      verification.
    </UsageItem>
    <UsageItem variant="dont">
      Present all outputs with the same implied certainty; hide or downplay uncertainty.
