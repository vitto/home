Yes, **horses are herbivores**: their diet is based exclusively on plant materials. They feed primarily on grass, hay, straw, leaves, fruits, and vegetables. Their digestive system is specifically adapted to digest plant fiber, thanks to a long intestine and a fermentation system in the cecum and colon.

They require a high-fiber diet to maintain digestive health and prevent problems like colic. Want to know more about their diet or specific care?
