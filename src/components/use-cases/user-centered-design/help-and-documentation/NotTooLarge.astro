            <strong>Introduction to Password Security</strong><br />
            Password management is a critical aspect of digital security. This comprehensive guide covers
            all aspects of password management, from basic concepts to advanced security protocols. Understanding
            password security requires knowledge of cryptography, hashing algorithms, and security best
            practices...

            <strong>Chapter 1: Understanding Password Hashing</strong><br />
            Passwords are stored using one-way hash functions. The system uses bcrypt with a salt factor
            of 12. When you create a password, it goes through multiple transformation layers: first,
            the input is normalized to handle Unicode characters, then it's salted using a cryptographically
            secure random number generator...

          <mds-text typography="detail">
            <strong>Chapter 2: Password Complexity Requirements</strong><br />
            The system enforces password complexity through a multi-stage validation process. Minimum
            length is 8 characters, but we recommend 12 or more. The password must contain at least one
            uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character from the set:
            !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?...</>

              <strong>Chapter 3: Password Reset Workflow</strong><br />
              The password reset process involves multiple steps and security checks. When you request
              a password reset, the system generates a time-limited token using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
              with a 1-hour expiration. This token is hashed and stored in our Redis cache with a TTL
              (Time To Live) of 3600 seconds...

              <strong>Chapter 4: Edge Cases and Error Handling</strong><br />
              Various edge cases must be considered: what happens if the user requests multiple password
              resets within a short time frame? The system implements rate limiting using a token bucket
              algorithm. If more than 3 reset requests are made within 15 minutes, the system will temporarily
              block further requests...

              <strong>Chapter 5: Troubleshooting Common Issues</strong><br />
              If you encounter issues changing your password, first check your browser's console for JavaScript
              errors. Verify that cookies are enabled and third-party cookies are not blocked. Clear your
              browser cache and try again. If the problem persists, check your network connection and
              ensure you're not behind a corporate firewall that might be blocking API requests...

              <strong>Appendix A: Technical Specifications</strong><br />
              The password change endpoint is located at /api/v1/users/password. It accepts POST requests
              with Content-Type: application/json. The request body must include currentPassword (string,
              required), newPassword (string, required, minLength: 8), and confirmPassword (string, required)...
