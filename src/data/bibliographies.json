    "description": "Creating a flexible UI system that is consistent and easy to customize, while also scalable and cost-efficient, depends not only on how it is built, but on how it is designed. A library of components has very little value if every new design is created independently, ignoring established standards and patterns. In this article, Adriana De La Cuadra explains the value of modularity in UI design and how it ties into the process of style guide-driven development, which improves the implementation of flexible and user-friendly applications, while helping designers and developers collaborate more productively.",
